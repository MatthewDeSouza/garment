# Garment Simulator

This is a simple garment simulator that utilizes the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java. The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This way, you can easily add new product families or extend existing ones without modifying the core code.
